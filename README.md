This project explores how blockchain can transform the U.S. banking sector, focusing on payments, lending, regulation, and emerging financial products like CBDCs.
Future Implications and Innovations
1. Financial Inclusion

Impact: Banks might see increased competition from decentralized systems targeting populations excluded from traditional banking.
2. Disruption of Traditional Banking Models
As blockchain technology becomes more integrated, traditional banks may face challenges in maintaining their business models, especially regarding intermediaries and transaction fees.
Impact: Banks will need to innovate and adapt to remain competitive in a blockchain-powered financial ecosystem.
3. The Rise of Blockchain-Based Financial Products
Expect more blockchain-driven innovations in insurance, lending, and real-time settlements.
Impact: These innovations may redefine the way banking and financial products are structured and delivered.
